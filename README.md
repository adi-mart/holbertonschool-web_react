## Description

The Web React track is designed to teach students how to build dynamic, interactive web applications using TypeScript and React. The curriculum begins with foundational TypeScript concepts and gradually introduces more advanced topics, culminating in full-stack React development.

This repository includes a series of hands-on tasks that reinforce learning through practical implementation.

## Technologies

- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing
- **Webpack**: Module bundler for building the projects
- **Babel**: JavaScript compiler for backward compatibility
- **ESLint**: Linting tool for code quality
- **Jest**: Testing framework for unit tests
- **HTML/CSS**: For basic web page structure and styling

## Installation

Each task is a separate Node.js project. To work on a specific task:

1. Navigate to the task directory:
   ```bash
   cd TypeScript/task_X
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. For development with hot reload:
   ```bash
   npm run start-dev
   ```

## Usage

### Building
To build any task:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Development Server
To start the development server:
```bash
npm run start-dev
```

### Testing
To run tests:
```bash
npm test
```
